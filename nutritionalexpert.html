            <p>Welcome to our Health and Wellness community! Our expert, <strong>Dr. Megan Coltrin</strong>, is a certified nutritionist with over 5 years of experience in holistic wellness. 
                Dr. Coltrin believes in empowering individuals to make sustainable, healthy choices.</p>
            <p>"I'm passionate about empowering others to experience true health!

                After experiencing my own health issues, I decided to take matters into my own hands and learn how to become the healthiest version of myself. I am here to help others do the same through their nutrition, lifestyle, and fitness.
                
                I support clients through 1:1 consultations. I also provide corporate chats for companies looking to support their employee's performance, health, and overall happiness."</p>
